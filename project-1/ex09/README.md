# Project-1: Python Exercises

This project contains a series of Python exercises demonstrating various programming concepts and techniques.

## Exercise Directories

### ex01 - Name
**File:** `name.py`

Basic Python script that demonstrates variable assignment and f-string formatting. Defines first and last name variables and prints them together.

### ex02 - Boolean
**File:** `boolean.py`

Introduces boolean comparisons in Python. Compares two numbers (42 and -42) using equality, greater than, and less than operators, printing the results.

### ex03 - Lists
**File:** `lists.py`

Demonstrates working with Python lists. Contains a function that receives a list and prints each item on a separate line, showcasing list iteration.

### ex04 - Dicts
**File:** `dicts.py`

Explores Python dictionaries. Implements a function that receives a dictionary and prints key-value pairs as formatted strings using list comprehension and dictionary iteration.

### ex05 - Arguments
**File:** `arguments.py`

Introduces command-line argument handling using `sys.argv`. Prints all arguments passed to the script, or displays an error message with usage instructions if no arguments are provided.

### ex06 - First Function
**File:** `first_function.py`

Creates a greeting function with default parameters. Accepts names from command-line arguments and prints personalized greetings. Uses '42' as the default name when no arguments are provided.

### ex07 - Greetings from the Farm
**File:** `greetings_from_the_farm.py`

Builds on the previous exercise by incorporating the `cowsay` library. Generates ASCII art greetings using a cow character, demonstrating external library integration.

### ex08 - Weather
**File:** `weather.py`

Advanced exercise that demonstrates API integration using the `requests` library. Fetches geolocation data and current weather information from Open-Meteo API for a given city (defaults to SÃ£o Paulo).

### ex09 - README
**File:** `README.md`

This directory contains the project documentation file that describes all exercises in the project, created with Github Copilot AI Agent
